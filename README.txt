This JavaScript project uses JQuery to help create a simple Whack-A-Mole game. This project contains a few items:

	3 folders:
		css => contains css formating; provided by course instructor
		img=> contains image of mole for game; provided by course instructor
		js=> contains jQuery files
	
	1 file:
		index.html => contains html and javaScript code for running game.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
To Run:

	1) Ensure all 3 folders and index.html file are in the same folder location before running.

	2) Launch index.html in your favorite web browser (I used chrome when making this project but any will do)

Tips:

When a mole spawns it is given a random amount of time to remain on the screen. I suggest playing a few times to get a feel for the coding.

Have fun! I was able to polish this game up nicely during the course, but if I made any additions I would add sounds and a difficulty selector.
